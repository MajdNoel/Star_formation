Hey!

I am Majd, a first-year Msc student in theorotical astrophysics at Western university.


Research:
In the process of star formation, there are usually strong ejections of gas near the protostar. Prevoius researhc has shown
that magnetic fields plays a pivot role in the ejections of these Jets (very high speed ejections) and outflows (low speed
ejections). My research is in investigating the main driving forces of Jets and outflows from protostellar systems.
